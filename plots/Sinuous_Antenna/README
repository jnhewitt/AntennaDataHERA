This directory contains the results of CST simulations of sinuous antenna
designs for the HERA feed.    The sinuous trace is based on a function described
by a number of parameters.  Here we focus on the "growth rate," that determines
how many times the trace goes back and forth, and the outer radius.  To improve
the polarization performance of the antenna, we add a cylinder, similar
to the cylinder that was added to the crossed-dipole design of the current HERA
feed.  To improve the forward gain, we add a backplane.

All the simulations presented here are for the feed mounted on the HERA dish.

For the data presented here, we consider growth rates equal to 0.49 and 0.8,
outer radii equal to 175cm and 225cm, a cylinder diameter of 1.2 times the
diameter of the sinous structure, a cylinder height 0.3 times the diameter of
the sinuous structure, a backplane height (distance from the sinuous structure)
of 90cm and a backplane diameter of 0.95 times the diameter of the sinuous
structure.

We present data for five models:

(1)  Growth rate = 0.49, outer radius = 225cm, with cylinder, without backplane
(2). Growth rate = 0.8, outer radius = 225cm, with cylinder, without backplane
(3)  Growth rate = 0.8, outer radius = 175cm, with cylinder, without backplane
(4). Growth rate = 0.8, outer radius = 200cm, with cylinder, without backplane
(5). Growth rate = 0.8, outer radius = 175cm, with cylinder, with backplane
